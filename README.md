# Envira Albums correct cover size

Every time I use this plugin I keep forgetting how to make the album covers the same size.

Just ao I have it somewhere so that I don't forget.

1. Set up the album.
2. Set the number of columns e.g. 4
3. Unset Masanory option in Album
4. Set dimension to desired size  300x300
5. Tick for exact dimensions (this doesn't effect images in lightbox)
4. Set Album alignment center
